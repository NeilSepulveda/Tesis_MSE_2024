The sensor delivers the average of the odd harmonics of the voltage from the 5th harmonic to the 9th harmonic.
These harmonics are calculated because, as analysed in the measurements, they are the only ones that present high and constant values.
Moreover, from the 8th harmonic onwards, only noises with values close to zero are present.
