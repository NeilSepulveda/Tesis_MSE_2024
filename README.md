Algorithms used to carry out the work "Smart Meter of Alternating Electrical Energy for Energy Systems".

This work was carried out by the Civil Electrical Engineer Neil Sepúlveda Sepúlveda in order to obtain a Master's degree in "Sistemas Energéticos" at the Universidad Católica de la Santísimas Concepción, Chile.

I would like to thank Fondecyt Regular 1220903 and the UCSC postgraduate team for their support for the project.

Finally, I contribute to this work to encourage open science.
